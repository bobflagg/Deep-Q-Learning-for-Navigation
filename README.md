# Deep-Q-Learning-for-Navigation
My solution for Project 1 from [Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).  I've organized the code into there Python modules, which contain code common to the various implementation given to solve the navigation problem, and four Jupyter notebooks containing increasingly more efficient solutions.

## Python Modules

- [model.py](https://github.com/bobflagg/Deep-Q-Learning-for-Navigation/blob/master/model.py): implements an actor policy model as a simple neural network.
- [agent.py](https://github.com/bobflagg/Deep-Q-Learning-for-Navigation/blob/master/dqn_agent.py): defines an abstract RL agent for deep Q-learning which will be subclassed in the specific solutions.
- [trainer.py](https://github.com/bobflagg/Deep-Q-Learning-for-Navigation/blob/master/trainer.py): implements the training method for deep Q-learning.
